   Std 1003.1™-2008, 2016 Edition}. In the following, we will refer to
   it simple as POSIX.

   The type {!command} contains the definition of a Shell command in
   Morsmall. Compared to what can be found in the POSIX standard or in
   {{:https://github.com/colis-anr/morbig}Morbig}, this type is rather
   small. This is because a lot of syntactically distinct scripts that
   are semantically equivalent are identified in here. For instance,
   all the following scripts are equivalent and identified as such:
   {[
       if t1; then c1; elif t2; then c2; fi
       if { t1; }; then c1; elif { { t2; }; }; fi
       if t1; then c1; else if t2; then c2; fi; fi
   ]}

   {2 Simple Command}

   {e See POSIX, 2 Shell & Utilities, 2.9.1 Simple Command}

   {2 Lists and Pipelines}

   {e See POSIX, 2 Shell & Utilities, 2.9.2 Pipelines and 2.9.3 Lists}

   - {b Asynchronous Lists.} When encountering [Async c], the Shell
   shall execute [c] asynchronously in a subshell. This means that the
   shell shall not wait for the command to finish before executing the
   next command.

   - {b Sequential Lists.} {i A contrario}, the commands [c1] and [c2]
   in [Seq (c1, c2)] shall be executed sequentially.

   - {b AND Lists.} In [And (c1, c2)], [c1] shall be executed
   first. If its exit status is zero, [c2] shall be executed. The
   commands are expanded only if they are executed.

   - {b OR Lists.} In [Or (c1, c2)], [c1] shall be executed first. If
   its exit status is non-zero, [c2] shall be executed.

   - {b Pipeline.} In [Pipe (c1, c2)], the standard output of [c1]
   shall be connected to the standard input of [c2]. The standard
   input, standard output, or both of a command shall be considered to
   be assigned by the pipeline before any redirection specified by
   redirection operators that are part of the command.

   - {b Negation.} The command [Not c] has the same behaviour as [c],
   except for the exit status that shall be the logical NOT of the
   exit status of [c].

   {2 Compound Commands}

   {e See POSIX, 2 Shell & Utilities, 2.9.4 Compound Commands}

   - {b The Subshell Environment.} [Subshell c] shall execute [c] a
   subshell environment. Variable assignments and built-in commands
   that affect the environment shall not remain in effect after the
   list finishes.

   - {b The for Loop.} [For (x, l, c)] shall execute a sequence of
   commands [c] for each member in a list of items. It is to be noted
   that [l] is non-mandatory and is thus an option. Besides, there is
   an important semantic difference between [None] and [Some
   \[\]]. The former appears in a for loop where the list of words
   appear but is empty. In that case, the for loops through the empty
   list. The latter appears in a for loop where the list of words has
   been omitted. In that case, the for loops through the positional
   parameters.

   - {b The case Conditional Construct.} [Case (w, \[(\[p11;...\],c1);
   ...\])] shall execute the compound-list corresponding to the first
   one of several patterns that is matched by the string resulting
   from the expansion of the given word [w]. In order from the
   beginning to the end of the case statement, each pattern [p*] shall
   be subjected to expansion, and the result of these expansions shall
   be compared against the expansion of [w]. After the first match, no
   more patterns shall be expanded, and the corresponding [c*] shall
   be executed. The order of expansion and comparison of multiple
   patterns that label the same statement is unspecified.

   - {b The if Conditional Construct.} [If (c1, c2, c3)] shall execute
   [c1] and use its exit status to determine whether to execute [c2]
   or [c3]. In fact, [c3] is not mandatory and is thus an option.

   - {b The while Loop.} [While (c1, c2)] shall continuously execute
   [c2] as long as [c1] has a zero exit status.

   - {b The until Loop.} [Until (c1, c2)] shall continuously execute
   [c2] as long as [c1] has a non-zero exit status.

   {2 Function Definition Command}

   {e See POSIX, 2 Shell & Utilities, 2.9.5 Function Definition
   Command}

   A function is a user-defined name that is used as a simple command
   to call a compound command with new positional parameters. A
   function is defined with a {e function definition command},
   [Function (name, body)].

   This function definition command defines a function named [name:
   string] and with body [body: command]. The [body] shall be executed
   whenever [name] is specified as the name of a simple command.

   {2 Redirection}

   {e See POSIX, 2 Shell & Utilities, 2.7 Redirections}
